title: "Tailwindâ€™s @apply Feature is Better Than it Sounds"
description: "Most of the time, people showcase Tailwind's @apply feature with one of Tailwind's single-property utilities (which changes a single CSS declaration). When showcased this way, @apply doesn't sound promising at all. So obviously, nobody wants to use it. Personally, I think Tailwind's @apply feature is better than described."
