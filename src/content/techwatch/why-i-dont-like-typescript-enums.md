title: "Why I Don't Like Enums"
description: "The article explains why the author dislikes using TypeScript Enums, citing their inflexibility and poor compatibility with modern JavaScript features like objects and literal unions. Enums can introduce confusion and make code less predictable. Instead, the author recommends using alternatives like objects or union types, which offer better clarity, maintainability, and alignment with JavaScript's evolution."
