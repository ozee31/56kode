title: "How to control a React component with the URL"
description: "The article on Build UI explains how to sync React components with URL query parameters, focusing on keeping the state consistent between UI elements and the URL. It demonstrates practical steps for using hooks like useSearchParams and useRouter to manage the search input in a React app. By hoisting state into the URL, developers can enable features like back-and-forth navigation, refreshing, and shareable URLs without introducing bugs caused by duplicated states."
