title: "Improving rendering performance with CSS content-visibility"
description: "Nolan Lawson's article discusses how the CSS property content-visibility can significantly improve rendering performance by skipping the rendering of off-screen elements. This optimization is especially useful for complex or resource-heavy layouts. By hiding non-visible content until needed, developers can reduce layout and painting costs, making pages load and scroll more smoothly. Lawson provides practical examples and benchmarks to demonstrate how using content-visibility can lead to better performance without sacrificing visual integrity."
