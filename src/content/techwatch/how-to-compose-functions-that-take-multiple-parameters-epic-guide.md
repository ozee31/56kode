title: "How to compose JavaScript functions that take multiple parameters (the epic guide)"
description: "The article provides an in-depth guide on how to effectively compose functions in JavaScript that accept multiple parameters. It explores techniques such as function wrapping, partial application, and currying, which can simplify the handling of functions with multiple parameters.
The guide begins by discussing the challenges of composing functions that require multiple arguments and offers solutions like wrapping functions to accept arrays of arguments. It then delves into partial application, where you pre-apply some arguments to a function, creating a new function with fewer parameters. This approach is particularly useful for customizing functions and creating more reusable code. Currying is another technique covered, allowing you to transform functions into a series of unary (single-argument) functions, further simplifying their composition."
