title: "Animate to height: auto; (and other intrinsic sizing keywords) in CSS"
description: "The article introduces the interpolate-size property and the calc-size() function, enabling smooth CSS animations and transitions to intrinsic sizing keywords like auto, min-content, and max-content. These tools help create more natural transitions between size changes, addressing the challenge of animating to height: auto. Developers can now opt into these behaviors for smoother and more visually appealing animations in supported browsers."
