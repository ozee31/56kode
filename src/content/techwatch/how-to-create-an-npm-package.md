title: "How To Create An NPM Package"
description: "The article provides a step-by-step guide on how to create and publish an NPM package. It begins with setting up your project using npm init, which creates a package.json file to manage the project's configuration. You then write your code, ensuring it exports the necessary functions or modules. If youâ€™re using TypeScript, you need to compile your code into JavaScript. The article also emphasizes the importance of adding metadata, managing dependencies, and versioning the package correctly. Before publishing, you should test your package thoroughly and create a README.md for documentation. Finally, the package is published to the NPM registry using npm publish."
