title: "Building a Single-Page App with htmx"
description: "The article explores how to use htmx, a modern tool that extends HTML with AJAX-like functionality, to create a single-page application (SPA) without heavy JavaScript frameworks. It demonstrates building an interactive app by sending asynchronous requests and updating page content dynamically, all while maintaining a simple, server-driven approach. This method avoids the complexity of client-side frameworks like React or Vue, making it an appealing choice for lightweight applications."
