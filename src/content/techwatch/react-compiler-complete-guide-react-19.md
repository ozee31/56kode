title: "How to Use React Compiler â€“ A Complete Guide"
description: "This article discusses the React 19 compiler, which automates optimization tasks previously handled by hooks like useMemo() and useCallback(). While React's memoization techniques are valuable, over-optimization can hinder performance. With React 19, new features like Server Components, Server Actions, enhanced hooks, improved asset loading, and smoother Web Component integration aim to improve performance. The introduction of the compiler allows developers to focus more on writing efficient code without manually handling optimizations."
