title: "JS Dates Are About to Be Fixed"
description: "The article explains how JavaScript's new Temporal API, specifically the Temporal.ZonedDateTime object, resolves longstanding issues with date and time handling. Traditional JavaScript Date objects lose critical context like time zones, leading to inaccuracies. Temporal fixes this by accurately representing dates with time zones, handling Daylight Saving Time, and providing reliable date comparisons and arithmetic. This new API simplifies global time consistency in modern web development."
