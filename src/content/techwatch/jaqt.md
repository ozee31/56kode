title: "jaqt: javascript queries and transformations"
description: "JAQT is a JavaScript library that provides SQL and GraphQL-inspired functions, Array.select() and Array.where(), for working with arrays and objects. It enhances the native Array.map() and Array.filter() methods by adding syntactic sugar for easier querying, without introducing a custom query language. This allows users to perform complex data transformations using plain JavaScript, making the code both powerful and intuitive. The library is lightweight and flexible, designed for scenarios where ease of use is preferred over performance improvements."
