title: "Generate a PDF in React"
description: "The article on Space Jelly provides a guide on generating PDFs from HTML using JavaScript. It covers three main methods: html2pdf.js for client-side PDF generation from HTML, React PDF for creating PDFs in a React environment with a component-based API, and Puppeteer for automating browser actions to create PDFs. Each method has its pros and cons, with React PDF being highlighted as a versatile option for embedded text and ease of setup."
