title: "Replacing React code with CSS :has selector"
description: "The article explores how the new CSS :has selector can simplify React code by eliminating the need for complex JavaScript logic. It allows for targeting parent elements and handling UI interactions like focus states, form element conditions, and dynamic styling without relying on React's state or re-renders. The post provides examples where using :has improves accessibility, reduces unnecessary React components, and enhances performance."
