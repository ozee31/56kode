title: "React and FormData"
description: "The article explores how React developers can use FormData, a JavaScript standard, to handle form data in both controlled and uncontrolled components. It covers how to avoid using refs and directly extract form values, while discussing challenges with TypeScript compatibility. The piece also introduces tools like Zod for schema validation and highlights how modern React APIs, especially in version 19, integrate with FormData, with examples from frameworks like Remix."
