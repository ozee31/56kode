title: "Interface Segregation Principle in React"
description: "The article discusses the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) in React, emphasizing the importance of creating small, specific interfaces or prop definitions that only include necessary data. The principle suggests avoiding components that depend on more data than they use, which simplifies testing and maintenance. The article also addresses issues like prop drilling and offers solutions such as using React context or component composition to avoid passing unnecessary data through components."
