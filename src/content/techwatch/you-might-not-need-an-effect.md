title: "You Might Not Need an Effect"
description: "The article from the React documentation explains when it is unnecessary to use the useEffect hook. It provides common scenarios where developers mistakenly rely on effects and offers alternative ways to handle logic that don't involve useEffect, such as computing derived state or managing non-reactive values. The article emphasizes cleaner code and avoiding performance issues by using simpler React features instead of overcomplicating state management with effects."
