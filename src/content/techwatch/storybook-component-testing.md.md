title: "Component testing in Storybook"
description: "The blog post on Storybook discusses how component testing integrates with Storybook. It covers the importance of testing UI components in isolation, using Storybook to document and visually test components, and combining it with popular testing frameworks like Jest and Testing Library. This allows for better debugging and ensuring that individual components behave as expected before integrating them into larger applications."
