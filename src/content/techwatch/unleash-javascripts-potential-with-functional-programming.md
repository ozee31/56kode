title: "Unleash JavaScript's Potential with Functional Programming"
description: "The article on functional programming with JavaScript discusses how this approach can unlock greater potential in coding. It explains how functions are treated as first-class citizens, enabling cleaner, more modular, and reusable code. Key concepts like higher-order functions, immutability, and pure functions are covered, emphasizing their benefits for writing more predictable and testable code. This approach encourages a shift away from traditional imperative coding towards a declarative style that simplifies complex logic."
