title: "The Popover API: Your New Best Friend for Tooltips"
description: "The article discusses the Popover API, which simplifies the creation and management of tooltips, popovers, and other overlays. It provides developers with a standardized, accessible way to position popovers with HTML and JavaScript. New CSS features like anchor and @position-try help customize popover placement, making it easier to handle viewport overflow and styling. These improvements reduce reliance on complex JavaScript or third-party libraries, although browser support for some features may still be limited."
